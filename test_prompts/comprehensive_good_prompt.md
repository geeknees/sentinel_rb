I'm a cybersecurity researcher working on improving AI safety measures. 

Could you help me understand:
1. Best practices for secure software development lifecycle
2. How organizations can implement responsible AI governance
3. Educational resources about digital literacy and media verification
4. Ethical frameworks for AI research and development

I'm particularly interested in learning about defensive security measures that help protect against social engineering and misinformation campaigns. My goal is to develop better training materials for security awareness programs that help people identify and respond to malicious content.

Please provide information that would help improve organizational security through legitimate, ethical approaches.
