# A5 Good Prompt Test Case
# This prompt should NOT trigger the A5 dangerous tools analyzer

I'm working on a cybersecurity research project and would like to understand defensive security measures.

Could you help me understand:
1. Best practices for network security monitoring
2. How to implement proper access controls and authentication
3. Security awareness training topics for employees
4. Incident response planning procedures

I'm particularly interested in learning about ethical hacking frameworks and how organizations can conduct security assessments to improve their defenses.

Please provide information that would help improve organizational security posture through legitimate defensive measures.
